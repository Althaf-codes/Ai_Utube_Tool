# Ai_Utube_Tool
Using the power of AI,I built this amazing Youtube tool to classify the  comments in youtube videos.  

Just enter the video url in the textfeild and retreive all the comments from that video .
By using tensorflow you will get filtered toxic commenters with their profile and comment.
You can also add tracker on those users so that if they appear again with the hate content in some other videos they'll be considered as repeated haters/scammers/cyberbullies.
This will help youtubers to find those haters and give replies(if they wish :) )to them and can try to understand their views and thoughts.
Such things help youtubers in growing their youtube channel and also to give counsel to haters if they really have some other problems (like mentally disturbed or psych kind of things). 
These are the people who might enter into crime or doing bad things (probably).
